## Thoughts behind design 

- Number of tabs: I want the review to be as comprehensive as possible but at the same time keep it succint and not demand much time of the user.
- Quick Suggestions: 1 line suggestions for users.
- With Audio recordings it is important to have controls for user to navigate around the audio.


## Future Scope

- Add a timestamp for each audio segment.
